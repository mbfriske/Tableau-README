Trip Data by Count:
The top bike usage occurs on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, within the times of 6AM-9AM and 5PM-7PM. Taking the reverse of this, the lowest usage occurs Saturday, between the time of 1AM to 4AM. This lowest usage time would be the most ideal period to service and maintain bicycles, as it would be the least time to interfere with users and the time when the highest amount of bicycles will not in use.

Trip Data by Gender:
The high majority of users are male. While female users are increasing, male users are increasing at a higher rate. This means there is opportunity to increase use within the female community. Currently, the highest grouping of females by age is 33 and 30, while for males is between 35 and 39 years old. Also, there are no male "Customers", but a slight amount of female "Customers". Between both metrics, advertising should target females between the age of 35 to 39, while promoting "Customers" to obtain a subscription.
